Linear Regression live fitting by interacting with data points!\
Tensorflow js and p5 js used as backend for this project!\
I tried to make **Linear Regression** and **Polynomial Regression** more fun!\
It is a supervised learning algorithm with its origins from Statistics that assumes a linear relationship between features(input classes like house, size/area) and labels(output class like price of a house).\
**In the Lin-UI.html file,
We can observe the LIVE Working of Gradient Descent, an optimizer for Linear Regression**. It is trying to optimize values by minimizing mean squared error.\
**In the Poly_UI.html file, we can observe Polynomial regression having equation y= ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e.**
Finally, Output Line is trying to fit the direction of least error.\
We take the Learning rate as we desire here, acting as a scale factor.\
It can be used for beginners to visualize ML, since its all about fitting the curve!\ 
Also,**Cheers to Tensorflow.js!**
