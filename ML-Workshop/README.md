Linear Regression live fitting by interacting with data points!
Tensorflow js and p5 js used as backend for this project!
I tried to make Linear Regression more fun! 
It is a supervised learning algorithm with its origins from Statistics that assumes a linear relationship between features(input classes like house, size/area) and labels(output class like price of a house).
In the ui.html file,
We can observe the LIVE Working of Gradient Descent, an optimizer for Linear Regression. It is trying to optimize values by minimizing mean squared error.
Finally, Output Line is trying to fit the direction of least error..
We take the Learning rate as 0.5 here, acting as a scale factor.
It can be used for beginners to visualize ML, since its all about fitting the curve! 
Also, Cheers to Tensorflow.js!
