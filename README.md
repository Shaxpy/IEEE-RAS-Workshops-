# IEEE-RAS-Workshops-
This is a compilation of a series of presentations that were used during the course of IEEE- Robotics and Automation workshops. 
Such materials helped the students to establish their basics in the field of Robotics and IoT.

The third workshop was a total practical and we helped students build actual War robots and LFRs!
